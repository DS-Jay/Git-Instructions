## 1. Introduction to Version Control and GitHub <a name="introduction"></a>

### What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that helps track changes to files over time. It allows you to review project history to find out:

- Which changes were made?
- Who made the changes?
- When were the changes made?
- Why were changes needed?

### Why GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It's particularly useful for data professionals because it:

- Facilitates collaboration on data projects
- Provides a centralized repository for code and data
- Offers features like issue tracking and project management
- Integrates well with many data science tools and platforms

## 2. Setting Up GitHub <a name="setup"></a>

### Creating a GitHub Account
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click "Sign up"
2. Choose a username, enter your email, and create a password
3. Verify your account

### Installing Git
- **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
- **macOS**: Install via Homebrew: `brew install git`
- **Linux**: Use your distribution's package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install git`

### Configuring Git
Set up your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## 3. Basic Git Commands <a name="basic-commands"></a>

### Initializing a Repository
```bash
git init
```

### Cloning a Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### Checking Status
```bash
git status
```

### Adding Files
```bash
git add filename    # Add a specific file
git add .           # Add all files
```

### Committing Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
```

### Pushing Changes
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Pulling Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

## 4. Branching and Merging <a name="branching-merging"></a>

### Creating a Branch
```bash
git branch branch-name
git checkout -b branch-name  # Create and switch to new branch
```

### Switching Branches
```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

### Merging Branches
```bash
git checkout main
git merge branch-name
```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts
1. Open the conflicting file(s)
2. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Edit the file to resolve the conflict
4. Add the resolved file (`git add filename`)
5. Complete the merge (`git commit`)

## 5. Collaborative Workflows <a name="collaborative-workflows"></a>

### Forking a Repository
1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner

### Creating Pull Requests
1. Create a new branch for your changes
2. Make your changes and commit them
3. Push the branch to your fork
4. Go to the original repository and click "New pull request"
5. Select your branch and provide a description of your changes

### Reviewing Pull Requests
1. Go to the "Pull requests" tab in the repository
2. Click on a pull request to review
3. Examine the changes, leave comments, and approve or request changes

## 6. GitHub Features for Data Science <a name="data-science-features"></a>

### Jupyter Notebook Integration
- GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks, making it easy to share and view analyses
- Use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for more reliable rendering of large notebooks

### GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Set up automated testing and deployment pipelines
- Example: Automatically run unit tests on every push

### GitHub Packages
- Store and version data files, models, and other artifacts
- Integrate with pip or conda for easy installation of your data science packages

## 7. Best Practices for Data Projects <a name="best-practices"></a>

### Project Structure
```
project/
│   README.md
│   requirements.txt
│
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
│
├── notebooks/
│   └── exploratory/
│
├── src/
│   └── utils/
│
└── tests/
```

### .gitignore for Data Science
Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude:
- Large data files
- Sensitive information (API keys, credentials)
- Temporary files and caches

Example `.gitignore`:
```
# Data files
*.csv
*.json
*.pkl

# Jupyter Notebook
.ipynb_checkpoints

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Virtual environment
venv/
env/

# IDE-specific files
.vscode/
.idea/
```

### Documentation
- Write clear README files
- Use docstrings in Python code
- Consider using tools like Sphinx for generating documentation

## 8. Advanced GitHub Topics <a name="advanced-topics"></a>

### Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- Use for versioning large datasets or model files
- Install Git LFS and track large files:
  ```bash
  git lfs install
  git lfs track "*.csv"
  ```

### GitHub Issues and Project Boards
- Use Issues for tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests
- Set up Project Boards for kanban-style project management

### GitHub Pages
- Host documentation or data visualization dashboards directly from your repository

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

### Undoing Changes
- Discard local changes: `git checkout -- filename`
- Undo last commit: `git reset HEAD~1`

### Handling Large Files
- If you accidentally commit a large file:
  1. Remove the file: `git rm --cached large_file.dat`
  2. Commit the removal: `git commit --amend -CHEAD`
  3. Push force (use cautiously): `git push --force origin main`

### Authentication Issues
- Use SSH keys for secure authentication
- Or use a personal access token for HTTPS authentication
